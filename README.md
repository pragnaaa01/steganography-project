# steganography-project
This project demonstrates the concept and implementation of steganography, the practice of hiding secret information within non-secret mediaâ€”in this case, hiding a message inside an image using the Least Significant Bit (LSB) technique.  The application allows users to encode a secret message into the pixel data of an image and later decode it.
